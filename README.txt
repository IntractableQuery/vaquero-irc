==About
Vaquero is an IRC library I wrote around the summer of 2007.  At the time
it was (and even now, in 2010, I suspect it remains still) the most
fully-featured IRC parser.  DCC support is probably the only thing lacking,
since Pircbot is slightly better-featured in this respect.

I have a more detailed list of features, but will (hopefully) update
this readme with them once I pull my old website from my backups.  

It is unlikely I will continue development of this library.  Fully-featured IRC 
support through Java is a hassle, more a fault of IRC itself.  However, 
I did want to release it publicly in case anyone wants to refer to its 
documentation or see how another implementation works.  I still refer to it 
from time-to-time to look up weird little ircd-specific features that I had 
documented.

The only real weakness I see in this library is that it does not have a very
strong threading model.  IRC events are dispatched from the same thread that
reads the IRC input stream... not quite optimal.  Also, I wouldn't consider
it a stable library; it was still not quite finished when I stopped working
on it, although the vast majority of necessary features are intact.

==License
You may assume that the code is provided under the GPLv3.
